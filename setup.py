"""
This setup.py will be responsible for creating my machine learning application as a package. 
âœ… What setup.py will do for your ML application:
Defines your app as a package â€” so others (or future you) can pip install it easily.
Includes metadata â€” name, version, author, description, license, etc.
Specifies dependencies â€” like scikit-learn, pandas, flask, etc.
Packages code automatically using find_packages().
Can include scripts/entry points â€” useful for launching your app (e.g., starting a training pipeline or web server).
Enables distribution via PyPI or internal sharing (e.g., via wheel or source tarball).

from setuptools import find_packages,setup
## setup : This is the main function from setuptools used to configure your Python package.It tells Python how to build, install, and distribute your project.
## find_packages() automatically searches for all Python packages (i.e., directories that contain an __init__.py file) in your project folder, and returns a list of them to include in your distribution.
# So, If you want a folder to be included as a Python package (i.e., detected by find_packages() and included in your distribution), then:
#ðŸ”¸ It must contain an __init__.py file â€” even if it's empty...
